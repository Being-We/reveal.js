description: laying out the ongoing development of Second Civilization high-level structure
---

# cC initial devmap

## intro

This is the initial iteration 00.00 mapping the current development of Second Civilization high-level structure. Once the structure have been given a first outfolding, this version 00.00 will be reiterated into version 00.01 by the creation of a new gitbook variant. Once the development have reached a stage where these materials start making out some level of public documentation, the idea is to raise the version number to 01.00. This idea on versioning may though come to change at any instance along the way.

`NOTE: on this peice of work, the Second Civilization is abreviated`**`cC`** `( maybe think of it as the civilized Civilization =)`

{% hint style="warning" %}
BEWARE: Second Civilization is still in the earliest stages of development, **expect changes** to occur without notice thereof
{% endhint %}

right here `(00.00)`and now `(2020.08)`we work on figuring out how to adapt the [second civilization](https://opencollective.com/secondcivilization) original structure to include a best fit also against the [Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/) while at the very same exploring how _**gitbook**_ could fit in with our undertaking to inspire the rise of highly participatory _real world systems_ development

the objective right now is to create a first overall structure that works smoothly with using the _**open collective platform**  \(and gitbook\)_ to enable, support and guide the **Second Civilization** mission to provide openly accessible implements for participatory human and world development.

NOTE: this gitbook itself makes out as a part of the effort to integrate smoothly with the open collective platform \(which also that makes use of gitbook for it's own platform documentation\)

## devmap 00.00

the following is a work in progress that may come to change several times, though right now the aim is to:  both **preserve** the Second Civilization original structure while **adapting** it ****to the _**open collective platform**_  \(and gitbook\) to make it cognitively easy for people to across the board work with items and descriptions intrinsic to different platforms, frameworks, systems and their constituting structures

> currently this seems promisingly feasible due the fortunate fit between Second Civilization structural systems models and the open collective terminology on participants and entities \(even the visual language appear rest on a similar basis=\)

### participatory economics?

testing new platforms is a great opportunity for seeking out new avenues of own development, whereas here such an first avenue is to explore the possibility-space of employing the open collective platform as a means for the provision of real world systems spaces to cooperative multi-stakeholder partnerships 

_these spaces may or may not come to reflect and maybe even make out a primary representation for ongoing work on: **global theory, problem-space, conflict-space, possibility-space and opportunity-space**_

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="global theory" %}
the circumstances of a planet-wide human civilization differ from all previous civilizations, making us having to seek out new working approaches on human and world development better suited for today's evermore inter-linked, inter-connected, interdependent human age

if never before then by now we should have realized we can not make us independent the planet, the nature nor one another, but instead  learn to accept and even take advantage from embracing sincere mentalities, attitudes and structures for coexistence among ourselves as human beings as well as with the very planet, all living and life itself.

in this both inescapable and highly beneficial planet-wide circumstance of coexistence, it is here considered that the future of human civilization will grow increasingly dependent on human agreement in all its forms and to every extent.

#### the weakest link

in a world of present time levels of abstraction and complexity, **the weakest link** is never again any one individual human being but instead elements, aspects and phenomenons in the complex bodywhole of abstractions.

FUNDAMENTALS 00.00

There is no final end to the amount of ways we could look at problems as well as define, explain, understand and deal with problems. It can begin already with questions such as _what_ is a problem, what does the _word_ "problem" stand for  and how to possibly find and agree on a _definition_ that covers it all, and for everyone

Such is the nature of problems that there can be no end to the problems about problems, which also makes problems useable as means against attempts to solve or dissolve them



defining the problem in ways that make it optimally possible to either solve it or else dissolve it \(straight on make the problem disappear\)

{% tab title="relations platform" %}
the relations platform provides a modern time ontological foundation for everyoneÂ´s _own, shared, mutual development of ways of relating to worldviews, perceptions of reality and views on human being_

The key to a 21st century real world ontology lies in the ability to make distinction between the imagined and the actual. Even though it can sound trivial at first, one may quite soon come to experience that in reality it is not always straightforward simple to tell apart _the imagined_ from **the actual.**

{% code title="devnote:  EVENTUAL SAMPLES ON POSSIBLY ALARMING DEVELOPMENTS" %}

so called "armed conflict between countries" or "war"
increasing levels of abstraction (sciences, world systems)
more abstraction, more levels, more links = more complexity
global identity crisis 
"data is the new oil"
adaptive data analytics (e.g. algorithms, "AI")
global automation 
from concentraion of power to loss/concentration of agency
