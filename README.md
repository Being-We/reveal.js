# ABOUT



{% hint style="warning" %}
BEWARE: Second Civilization is still in the earliest stages of development, **expect changes** to occur without notice thereof
{% endhint %}

right here and now we work on figuring out how to adapt the [second civilization](https://opencollective.com/secondcivilization) original structure to include a best fit also against the [Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/)

the objective right now is to create a first overall structure that works smoothly with using the _**open collective platform**_ to enable, support and guide the **Second Civilization** mission to provide openly accessible implements for participatory human and world development.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: this gitbook itself makes out as a part of the effort to integrate smoothly with the open collective platform \(which also that makes use of gitbook for it's own platform documentation\)
{% endhint %}

the following work in progress may come to change several times, though the aim is to:

* both **preserve** the Second Civilization original structure and **adapt** to the open collective platform to cognitively make it seamlessly easy for everyone to work across the board of systemic descriptions and worldly understandings 
  * _this seems highly feasible due the fortunate fit between Second Civilization structural systems models and the open collective terminology on participants and entities \(even the visual language appear rest on a samwise basis=\)_ 
* the open collective platform is currently considered for the provision of systems spaces to cooperative multi-stakeholder partnerships 
  * _these spaces may or may not come to reflect and maybe even make out a primary representation for ongoing work on: **global theory, problem-space, conflict-space, possibility-space and opportunity-space**_

* part representing the original ecosystem by the Second Civilization labs and part, enabling creation, forking and expansion into other new or existing ecosystem structures that take yet one more crosscut focal on participatory human and world development
