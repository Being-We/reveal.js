`DEVNOTE  
already got a conceptual notion including its first namespaces, so now explore it to see if and where there's any relevant substance to it`

* `seek out the descriptors under each tabbed namespace`
*  `assert the construes fitness for the role of primary containers ion the open collective platform`
*  `seek out a disposition for locating the spaces in accordance with above developments, test it and learn from that`

The overall circumstances of a planet-wide human civilization differ from all the territorially demarcated civilizations of the past. This territorial relocation of concerns from separate local order to globally mutual spaces, is in much the trigger in what makes us seek out new planetary-scale working approaches on human and world development. 

As our present time not only harbors the initial age of todayÂ´s planet-wide human civilization, but also hosts a growing array of planetary-scale critical challenges across the board of humanity, nature and world systems - a globally working approach need to be of global relevance beyond the geographic sense of it by stretching the meaning of "global" to reach all the way into mental and worldly representations with a capacity to span across all dimensions of _human and world development._

meaning that the mental items as well as as the systems labels and properties which are to carry today's planet-wide civilization into the futures; need to be items and labels that are globally usable across all aspects of our real world systems, of course  including also across the globe in a geographic sense.



the inter-linked, inter-connected, interdependent buildup of today's planet-wide human existence makes our real world systems, our human civilization and our lives to gain never before reach for human potential along the world-wide interconnected capacity while at the same ever larger pools of human life become exposed to  the effects when a link breaks down in the global weave 

in a world of present time levels of abstraction and complexity, **the weakest link** is never again any one individual human being but instead elements, aspects and phenomenons in the complex bodywhole of abstractions. 

? \("business as usual" may today translate into untradeable mental items such as "your weakness is my strength" or more concisely "my power stem out of the shortcomings of our human systems"\)

a **developer framework** capable of hosting multiple ecosystems provided as intrinsic parts of the system and also contributed developments from the participatory communities as well as various default and contributed sets of linkable or hookable connections across ecosystems

better suited to this second generation of human world

it is here considered that the future of human civilization will be increasingly dependent on human agreement or not in all forms  and every possible extent

FUNDAMENTALS 00.00

There is no final end to the amount of ways we could look at problems as well as define, explain, understand and deal with problems. It can begin already with questions such as _what_ is a problem, what does the _word_ "problem" stand for  and how to possibly find and agree on a _definition_ that covers it all, and for everyone

Such is the nature of problems that there can be no end to the problems about problems, which also makes problems useable as means against attempts to solve or dissolve them



defining the problem in ways that make it optimally possible to either solve it or else dissolve it \(straight on make the problem disappear\)
